# Ontario Energy Use: Predicting demand from weather and population data

Ontarians use more than 140 million megawatt hours of electricity a year to run their homes, businesses, hospitals, schools, transit and infrastructure. It is clear that weather and population play a huge influence in the demand for energy. In order to meet client demands for electricity, energy companies need a robust model. More energy is typically demanded during the day than at night when people are sleeping, but since the change in weather can also affect changes in demand for energy, companies need to be able to anticipate large spikes in demand in order to prevent blackouts.

The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) operates and settles Onatrio's electricity wholesale market, where the market price is set based on accepted offers to supply electricity against the forecasted demand. In this project we look at the historical hourly energy demand of Ontario, Canada from January 1994 until August 2017, the historical energy price, both from the IESO, the historical population as well as the historical hourly weather data for Toronto from the same time period from Environment Canada's historical climate data.


**The Goal: Develop a model that predicts energy demand based on weather, price and population data.**
